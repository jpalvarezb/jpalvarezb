# Hi, I'm JP

## Welcome to My GitHub

I'm a data scientist and AI engineer focused on building robust, real-world systems. My background bridges digital marketing and data infrastructure, with an emphasis on delivering AI that solves concrete problems.

My current work involves multi-agent architectures, cloud-based ML deployment, and NLP-driven decision tools. I'm especially interested in human-centered AI systems that enhance, rather than replace, real work.
